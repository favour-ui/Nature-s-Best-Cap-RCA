# Nature's Best Drink leakyCap RCA

## Context and Problem
During the same operational week at the Onitsha plant, Nature Best Juice Co. experienced an unusual and sharp spike in Leaky Cap defects across multiple production lines. The issue was concentrated on Wednesday, July 2, 2025, and Thursday, July 3, 2025, significantly exceeding defect levels recorded on other days within the week. This sudden rise in defective caps disrupted normal production performance and highlighted a potential underlying issue within the capping process, materials, or operational controls that requires immediate investigation and resolution.
